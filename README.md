## Problem Statement

- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.

- Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions
- Less Loam amount is like to get Fully Paid
- Lesser the Interest Rate the chances of getting lesser Charge offs
- Launching Loans with lesser Term/tenure with attarctively lesser interest will be a good product that will less likely end in charge off
- Borrowers with lesser annual income likely to end up with high interest rate which could increase the chance of charge off
- higher loan amounts tend to have higer interest rates which might end up in charge off
